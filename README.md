# FFA KZ Tournament helper
Made 99.9% with AI (I dont know how to code) (might be a buggy mess)

2 pages, first one to add players with their countries and second to take care of the points :)

`Instructions: click green button called "<> Code", press "download zip", extract contents, open index.html`

(pro tip: you can search for the country by typing the start of it and the closest one will be chosen for more apm)
