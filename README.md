# KZ Tournament Manager
For managing:
- Traditional single elimination tournaments of 2-32 players
- FFA (free-for-all) point-based tournaments

Instructions: 
1. download the [latest release](https://github.com/jakkekz/KZTournamentManager/releases/latest)
2. extract contents
3. open main.html
4. enjoy

This is not perfect so I'd recommend experimenting before the tournament 😊
